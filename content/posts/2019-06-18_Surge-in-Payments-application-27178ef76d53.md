Payment solutions for a billion users.

{{< youtube Lee01Nw-Kqw >}}

Sharing this talk from Kunal Shah (Founder Freecharge, Cred) at CFA meet on Payments landscape. This insightful talk will touch many topics and you will learn about Indian businesses and consumers. Enjoy!

I have tried to summarise the insights from the talk. But I would suggest you to spare some time and watch it, there is so much to learn.

> _Insights from the talk-_

> _1\. China saw a surge in credit card holders after a surge in mobile wallets created._

> _2\. India’s workforce has one of lowest women employment, there is just one country where per-capita has increased despite low women participation in the economy- Saudi Arabia( but they had oil to offset that), so if we want to increase our per-capita .. women participation has to increase.( Bad fact: 100 million women left the workforce last year in India)._

> _3\. Top 100 apps of the world are doing money lending one way or another, lending is a feature not a business.( TikTok in China makes money through lending)_

> _4\. Low trust countries/economy have a general brands, TATA — from salt to cars they sell everything. That’s why India and China have super apps like Paytm, where one brand can do many things, U.S. and other high trust economy don’t have super apps, they crave for specialization.(Trust as a topic definitely deserves separate attention)_

> _Big companies like Uber, OYO, Ola , Zomato are all trust companies._

> _5\. Distribution is king, it’s near to impossible to fight a product with high distribution.(e.g. WhatsApp)_

> _7\. Kunal’s view on crypto assets(Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.), almost all currencies/religion scaled and got adopted because some bigger influencer endorsed it.( This is exactly what can happen, US can come out with its own crypto currency and everyone will just follow)_

As we have one of the youngest population in the world, youth have aspirations and consumption habits which is expanding exponentially. Also, our economy is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, which sets the stage for people looking for _Credit/money to spend on consumption, leisure, luxury, health, shopping, etc._

India is so much similar to China of 1960/80s. People are trying to join dots and bet big on similar patterns. “Some risks are riskier if not taken.”

Now to understand why every big company is trying a part of your digital transaction and a surge of digital financial products, we need to understand a very important economics concept: **Credit.**

[Credit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit.asp) is a broad term that has many different meanings in the financial world. It is generally defined as a contractual agreement in which a borrower receives something of value now and agrees to repay the lender at a later date — generally with **interest**.

With a part of your digital transactions, companies will enable credit so that you can buy insurance, investment plan, smartphone or just some cash. On top of it, they will charge you some % of credit as interest.

This is just one of the many monetization plans, we will see many versions of it.

Thanks for reading.
