If you are in your early twenties trying to figure out life, I am sharing some really good work that touched me and helped me think for myself. If you have been on the same boat, dive in and spend your weekend exploring, reflecting on things which really matters to you.

1.  First one is about thinking, how we should think and find our own way. How humans reached to the moon first and got wheels in their luggage later(funny). Also, how Elon musk dared to start a space company (SpaceX).
2.  The second one is from an Indian traveler who argues how getting married and having kids is not such a good idea, and how an average person falls in this trap because of society. This really got me thinking and exploring more about my life 10–20 years from now.
3.  The third one is a true story from a father about his son’s struggle in his adulthood and coming out the other side strong, motivated, fighting his own inner devils to stay in the game.
4.  The fourth one is a 4-year research work on human productivity cycle and human nature of staying relevant. The author also looks for answers in spirituality and from spiritual gurus to understand how to live a life. **_This is a must read for everyone._**

### 1\. [First Principles](https://jamesclear.com/first-principles)

> _First principles thinking is a fancy way of saying “think like a scientist.” Scientists don’t assume anything. They start with questions like,_ What are we absolutely sure is true? What has been proven?

> _In theory, first principles thinking requires you to dig deeper and deeper until you are left with only the foundational truths of a situation. Rene Descartes, the French philosopher and scientist, embraced this approach with a method now called Cartesian Doubt in which he would “systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt until he was left with what he saw as purely indubitable truths.”_

### 2\. [Perspective on Getting Married and Having Kids.](https://the-shooting-star.com/2019/06/16/how-travelling-changed-my-perspective-on-getting-married-having-kids/amp/?__twitter_impression=true)

> _I often receive emails from individuals who lament that they chose to get married or have children without fully comprehending its impact on the rest of their lives. When we make such an irreversible decision in our twenties or early thirties, we need to contemplate alternate viewpoints rather than accepting the only one offered to us._

> _If you don’t get married, people will wonder what’s wrong with you. If you do, they’ll come to your wedding and criticize the food and the skin color of the bride and how much the groom earns. If you don’t have a kid soon enough, they’ll wonder what’s wrong with you. If you have three kids, they’ll laugh at you for procreating so much._

### 3\. [STAY IN THE GAME](https://www.albertbridgecapital.com/drew-views/2019/6/17/stay-in-the-game)

> _It was a living hell for Max. And honestly it was a living hell for us too. There was nothing we could do about it. The most difficult thing for my wife and I to accept was that only Max could make the choices. It wasn’t up to us. We couldn’t save him. It was up to him if he was going to live, or going to die. As one of my best friends told me at the time, only Max could choose to live._

### 4\. [Your Professional Decline Is Coming (Much) Sooner Than You Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/work-peak-professional-decline/590650/)

> **It is much harder to struggle against irrelevance than against exploitation.**

> _Hindu teaching about the stages of life, or ashramas. The first is Brahmacharya, the period of youth and young adulthood dedicated to learning. The second is Grihastha, when a person builds a career, accumulates wealth, and creates a family. In this second stage, the philosophers find one of life’s most common traps: People become attached to earthly rewards-money, power, sex, prestige-and thus try to make this stage last a lifetime._

I hope you enjoyed this if you want to discuss any of the topics, feel free to reach out to me.
