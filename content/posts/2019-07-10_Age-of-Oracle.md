This is my attempt to connect dots and see what future lies ahead of us. I am going to discuss the chaos & complexity of our world, how we have managed to operate such big cities & organizations. How we are going to shape the modern world regarding fundamental rights, education, finance, etc. To understand this we should first try to understand how policies came into existence, why we need rights, how policies and laws have improved over time.

Hammurabi was the sixth king of the First Babylonian dynasty, reigning from c. 1792 BC to c. 1750 BC.

> **_Hammurabi’s_** _lasting contribution on western society was his set of laws written on twelve stones and displayed publicly for all to see, the most common being, “Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.” The laws are generally known as the Code of Hammurabi._

Hammurabi makes two main points in stele’s epilogue,

1.  Anyone in his kingdom could come to the statue, see (or hear) the words on it and “understand his problem, and may he be content in his heart.” In other words, it was a monument to the king’s sense of justice and a way to make his subjects feel better when they felt they had been wronged.
2.  The second point the epilogue makes is that the kings who succeed Hammurabi should not change or disregard these laws or try to alter the identity of the person who made them.

> _This two points are the foundation of law and order, first makes you believe that know one can be wronged, law and the state is going to protect you and punish the wrongdoer. And the second point is, no one can alter the law, everyone is supposed to abide by it._

In present, this forms the underlying principle of the constitution and the law & order (which have been evolved). If not for belief, we(humans) would have blown up ourselves long ago. Our belief/trust in religion, state/government, in each other has helped us scale and operate in such a complex world.

### Programmed systems

We have been building systems to manage and organize ourselves.

Now what we are seeing is centralization of trust. We have trusted Facebook with our data, we got exploited. Similarly, we are seeing a rise of various gatekeepers of trust. And if data is the new oil, we are seeing a handful of people centralizing it and looking for opportunities to exploit.

Facebook and Google use our data for precise advertisement, targeting products and services. Its scale has made it hard to protect their network from propaganda and brainwash, elections are manipulated through fake news and its harder to rollback. [**Facebook is ripe for exploitation — again — in 2020**](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/09/facebook-is-ripe-for-exploitation-again-in-2020)

> **We know that if we can just catch the eye of the algorithm, we can take the humans for granted.**

Banks have been the middleman for decades and gatekeeping the flow of money, they have been the worst kind, caused some of the major man-made catastrophes of the modern world. Some selected group of people is deciding the fate of mankind. There are people in Venezuela, Zimbabwe struggling for two meals a day.

The major reason we get affected by these superpowers (the chosen ones) is the basic human instincts of putting self-interest first above anything. We are only humans, after all, we have ownership interest, behavior and psychology problems causing these trends and patterns. We are bound to repeat the same mistakes again & again because of human behavior.

### What Next?

We are moving towards a permission-less and trust-less society, we are inventing tools of tomorrow to protect ourselves from this vicious cycle of human fault. How can we do this? By decentralizing and tokenizing the power. We have arrived in a time where we will be using programmable systems to make the transaction immutable.

Bitcoin is invented in the same ideology, to build a system which can’t be manipulated, controlled or stopped by anyone. We may see many such systems to operate in a truly trust-less, programmable, permission less world. I don’t need anyone’s permission to broadcast my view to the world through — ‘’Twitter”. I don’t need a bank to allow/restrict me transact overseas in bitcoins.

> **We have traffic signals, which is 100% programmed to manage traffic(humans and chaos) to move in sync. It’s so fascinating to see everyone agreeing on a system and following it. This is how other complex systems of the future will be designed.**

### Age of Oracle

This is what **Age of Oracle** will look like, a world where we program systems to manage conflicts. A system which is neutral to both parties, system which doesn’t have any behavior/self-interest issues.

> **_A response or message given by an oracle(programmed system), especially an ambiguous one._**

We have the constitution with stated rules and regulations for all type of wrongdoings. We can program a system with this law to derive on a solution to resolve conflicts. We can harness the power of programming, distributed systems to build immutable systems, where everyone abides by the law & order without any exception/exclusivity.

Thanks for reading. I would love to know what do you think about it and where would you want to see such innovation first.
