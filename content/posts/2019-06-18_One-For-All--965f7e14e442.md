Our monkey mind is bombarded with information flow in gallons/sec. We are tied up in this cycle of information crunching. It's too hard to unplug even for an hour. Every social platform, every web link, every notification is feeding our monkey actions, silly desires, negative emotions. It's getting harder and harder to resist, to let go, to miss out on things. Every single post from our connections, make us crave the experience, materialistic ownership, temptation to be loved back, getting that 100+ hearts on your Instagram post.

With all these temporary temptations to gain social status, we forget how temporary our lives are. We forget we are just a tenant in this world. There have been many who came and went. Everyone is walking around carrying their social baggage.

> _“The dead outnumber the living fourteen to one, and we ignore the accumulated experience of such a huge majority of mankind at our peril.”– Niall Ferguson on the lessons of history._

It just takes two generations to forget your existence. Let that sink in.

We have no obligation to do as per other people’s expectations. If someone has any expectation from you, it's their problem, not yours. You owe nothing to anyone.

Thanks for reading.
