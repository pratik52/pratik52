We are living in a tech dominant world. Technologists are redesigning every human interaction and experience, they are reshaping the world like never before, changing how & what we read/listen/buy/eat everything.

Technologists new and most aspiring gig now is to change how we store value. Also, we need to understand that money is one of the biggest experiment on earth, we have always been looking for an efficient store of value.

Their answer to the inefficient complex global currency system is **Bitcoin**. While the future of Bitcoin is uncertain, but ignoring technological disruption hasn’t served well to industries/companies/governments alike.

Now, let's find out if we should jump in and buy the dream of a single dominant world currency which is **_scarce, immutable by design._**

#### What makes Bitcoin a better solution & why should you own some :

*   It is decentralized, which means it can’t be controlled/manipulated, you don’t need a middleman(Banks/govt.), transactions are recorded on a shared ledger and verified by “miners” independently solving cryptographic problems and arriving at a consensus that the transaction is legitimate and should be added to the ledger permanently..
*   It is [deflationary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp), a normal FIAT currency’s value _halves_ every 23–25 years.
*   Bitcoin price at $100,000 is 1/3 the market cap of gold & less than 1/40 the global money supply. — [Anthony Pompliano](https://medium.com/u/1d0168ffead9)
*   Facebook’s announcement of [Libra](https://libra.org/en-US/) is a _wind_ energizing Bitcoin _fire_.

There has never been a market advancing many folds in such a small time.

> Considering this, there is a good risk to reward ratio. You will get more bang for your buck. Looks exciting, but it isn’t promising.

This makes a good case for risking some of your savings into Bitcoin which could be an opportunity of a lifetime.

#### Now let’s see what can possibly go wrong with Bitcoin :

*   Can Bitcoin just be a mirage, is the world too optimistic about Bitcoin & it’s a Utopian dream?
*   There is a trade-off between trust and efficiency, Bitcoin can handle only 7 transactions/second, scaling is a big issue.
*   There haven’t been many real-world usages of Bitcoin, yet.
*   Bitcoin is too volatile for many people to consider it as a medium of exchange, no one want’s to own a currency whose value fluctuates 100–200% within months.

*   Bitcoin has a steep learning curve, it is tough to educate average people about it.
*   There is also a very good chance that governments can appreciate the technology and instead of adopting Bitcoin, they go on to build their own version.

This is the risk, which should be considered before putting any penny into Bitcoin.

Instead of being too optimist or too pessimist about the future of Bitcoin, let’s be an opportunist and take a calculated risk. Because of the nature of such high-risk high reward assets, I would advise only risk what you can digest.

#### Golden Rule of Investing, Never invests in something you don’t understand.
