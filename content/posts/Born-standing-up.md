*We were comparing psychoanalysis with the making of art. I said, "Both require explorations of the subconscious, and in that way they are similar."*

*But there is a fundamental difference between the two. In psychoanalysis, you try to retain a discovery; in art, once the thing is made, you let it go."*

I DID STAND-UP COMEDY for eighteen years. Ten of those years were spent learning, four years were spent refining, and four were spent in wild success.

### His Observations & learnings from comic career -

- Darkness is essential: If light is thrown on the audience, they don't laugh;
- Comedy's enemy is distraction.
- I absorbed Wally Boag's timing, saying his next line in my head ("When they operated on Father, they opened Mother's male"), and took the audience's response as though it were mine. I studied where the big laughs were, learned how Wally got the small ones, and saw tiny nuances that kept the thing alive between lines.
- Stillness can be as deceptive as motion.
- All entertainment is or is about to become old-fashioned.
- Like the burlesque comedian, I am abnormally fond of that precision which creates movement.
- Comedy is a distortion of what is happening, and there will always be something happening.
- Another rule was to make the audience believe that I thought I was fantastic, that my confidence could not be shattered. They had to believe that I didn't care if they laughed at all, and that this act was going on with or without them.

### Reflection on life & doing comedy-

- I was generally unknown, in the smaller venues I was free to gamble with material.
- I explained to myself, the whole point of this comedy was to turn off the older crowd while reeling in the young.
- I have learned that people are uploading their lives into cyberspace and am convinced that one day all human knowledge and memory will exist on a suitable hard drive which, for preservation, will be flung out of the solar system to orbit a galaxy far, far away.
- A complicated childhood can lead to a life in the arts.
- Now that I had assigned myself to an act without jokes, I gave myself a rule. Never let them know I was bombing: This is funny, you just haven't gotten it yet. If - I wasn't offering punch lines, I'd never be standing there with egg on my face. It was essential that I never show doubt about what I was doing. I would move through my act without pausing for the laugh, as though everything were an aside.

### On Career

- Perseverance is a great substitute for talent.
- I would have struggled composing a real-world résumé, as my abilities were at best vague and at worst unusable.
- That fabulous quality that keeps you from knowing just how unsuited you are for what you are about to do.
