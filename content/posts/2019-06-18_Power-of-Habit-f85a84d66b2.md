I am writing my learnings from the book “ **The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do, and How to Change”.**

Humans are nothing but a collection of habits. And in the modern literate world, able to read and write isn’t enough. To gain an edge over others or to perform better than what you were yesterday, it's important to understand habits to achieve what we want if we can understand why we do what we do.

> **Habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort.**

Habits are loops of Cue -> Routine-> Reward

Over time, this loop-cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward-becomes more and more automatic. The cue and reward become intertwined until a powerful sense of anticipation and craving emerges.

To create a new habit,

> **First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards.**

Rather, to change a habit,

> **_You must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine._**

But we do know that for habits to permanently change, people must believe that change is feasible.

Belief is easier when it occurs within a community. People want to visit places that satisfy their social needs. Getting people to exercise in groups makes it more likely they’ll stick with a workout. You can change the health of the nation this way.

This is where we can play with our psych to perform better, like for saying you can simply put it out on social media platforms about your bad habits and how you are going to break it. _The same social media which has been a cause for depression will become your motivation and willpower because of social responsibility to deliver what you promise._

### Individuals have habits; groups have routines.

When people start habitually exercising, even as infrequently as once a week, they start changing other, unrelated patterns in their lives, often unknowingly. Typically, people who exercise start eating better and becoming more productive at work. They smoke less and show more patience with colleagues and family. They use their credit cards less frequently and say they feel less stressed. It’s not completely clear why. But for many people, exercise is a keystone habit that triggers widespread change. “Exercise spills over,” said James Prochaska, a University of Rhode Island researcher. “There’s something about it that makes other good habits easier.

> **Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over**_._

> **During turmoil, organizational habits become malleable enough to both assign responsibility and create a more equitable balance of power.**

> **Crises are so valuable, in fact, that sometimes it’s worth stirring up a sense of looming catastrophe rather than letting it die down.**

During turmoil/crises, organizational routines are most malleable, they are like hot molten iron, we can shape it as we please. A crisis is the best time to change/replace habits. Once a sense of crisis grips, everyone becomes more open to change.

Whether selling a new song, a new food, or a new crib, the lesson is the same: **If you dress a new something in old habits, it’s easier for the public to accept it.**

Radio Stations have to take risks on new songs, otherwise, people stop listening. But what listeners really want are songs they already like. So you have to make new songs seem familiar as fast as possible.

The oldest tricks of all is called sandwiching, where a new product is sandwiched between old familiar products.

### Even Revolutions are nothing but Habits.

*   **_A movement starts because of the social habits of friendship and the strong ties between close acquaintances._**
*   **_It grows because of the habits of a community, and the weak ties that hold neighborhoods and clans together._**
*   **_And it endures because a movement’s leaders give participants new habits that create a fresh sense of identity and a feeling of ownershi_**p.

I would highly recommend reading “The power of Habit”. It’s one of the most powerful things you can learn about. Programming ourselves is much harder if we don’t understand ourselves and it is also highly rewarding, once we master it. Have a great weekend.
