Try to understand the below statements, and arrive at a conclusion to understand what is logical thinking.

**Statement 1:** All men are mortal.

**Statement 2:** Socrates is a man.

— — — — -

→**_Therefore, Socrates is mortal._**

_The foundation of logical thinking is connecting information to arrive at a logically acceptable answer. Look at one more example,_

**Statement 1:** Babies are illogical.

**Statement 2:** Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile.

**Statement 3:** Illogical persons are despised.

— — — — -

→**_Therefore, babies cannot manage crocodiles._**

> **_Logical thinking_** _is the process in which one uses_ **_reasoning_** _consistently to come to a conclusion. Problems or situations that involve_ **_logical thinking_** _call for structure, for relationships between facts, and for chains of_ **_reasoning_** _that “make sense.”_

We are living in the age of leverage, rewards of good decisions have never been so enormous. We are all decision machines, our decisions pile up and we get results proportional to the quality of our decisions.

To traverse through the complex problems we should enable ourselves to make better decisions using thinking tools/framework called **“Mental models”**.

No one has put the importance of mental models better than [Julian](https://www.julian.com/) -

> **I believe your intellectual life is divided into two parts: before you embrace mental models and after.**

### Mental Models

Mental models are like guiding tracks, always keeping us close to the best approximate answer. It helps us travel the uncharted territory, and not to wander randomly for solutions. Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett, Bezos, Elon Musk all rely on mental models to solve some of the most challenging problems of all time.

There is no absolute solution to anything, what the most successful people do is try to stay close to the best approximate solution using mental models.

Some most popular mental models are -

**1\. First-principles**

What is the most efficient way to solve a problem if you started from scratch? If you look past humanity’s attempts to solve it, what is the best approach if you reasoned back up from its fundamental principles?

This is how Elon Musk decided to build the SpaceX. You can learn more about it [here](https://jamesclear.com/first-principles).

First-principles thinking is a fancy way of saying “think like a scientist.” Scientists don’t assume anything. They start with questions like, What are we absolutely sure is true? What has been proven?

**2\. Regret minimization**

“When I’m 80 and looking back on my life, would I regret not taking this opportunity?

That is what Jeff Bezos asked himself \[before starting Amazon\]. He calls this the regret minimization framework.”

**3\. Pareto Principle**

The **Pareto** principle (also known as the 80/20 rule) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

e.g. — Only 20% of your networking will be fruitful. Once we have figured out those people, we should double down on them.

Another e.g. — 20% of the stocks generate 80% of the wealth for an investor.

#### There are many such models, you can find the list here.

Knowing about mental models is one thing and implementing it is a whole other game. We need concrete discipline to follow these models to get the most out of it.

To practice this, set a monthly/weekly review system of your processes, goals and run it through your own set of models and find out where are you lacking, what is pulling you back.
